We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"\"Here's The Beef\"\" pizza so we can both try them.

Full windows and earthy wooden walls give a feeling of warmth inside this restaurant perched in the middle of a farm.  The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.\n\nMy friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.\n\nThe entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.\n\nIf the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.</td><td>review</td><td>sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>zp713qNhx8d9KCJJnrw1xA</td><td>2010-02-12</td><td>riFQ3vxNpP4rWLk_CSri2A</td><td>5</td><td>\"Drop what you're doing and drive here.

All of the dishes were yummy. \nI have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid. \nOnce, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!</td><td>review</td><td>fpItLlgimq0nRltWOkuJJw</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>wct7rZKyZqZftzmAU-vhWQ</td><td>2008-03-21</td><td>B5h25WK28rJjx4KHm4gr7g</td><td>4</td><td>Not that my review will mean much given the more in-depth reviewers but I will chime in nonetheless...\n\nI can really only review one dish, the #3 lunch special, Yellow Curry Chicken. I don't know what the authentic name for it is, Kang Karee something or other. It's so tasty that the first time I had it I knew I'd never branch out. Good lunch spot if you work around downtown. Not the quickest service all the time and can get busy during lunch, but always consistently good.

Place was empty at 9am on a Tuesday morning but the atmosphere was casual, this place is pretty much been here for as long as I can remember and I am one of the 2 people that are native to Phoenix.  I always felt it was pricey but I think inflation has caught up since prices seemed normal when I went yesterday.  I loved the chips and salsa, the hot sauce is fantastic with a great spicy kick.  I went with the recommendation of the chile relleno which isn't my favorite but I like going with what waiters say so I gave it a try.  It was great!  Very flavorful and they just put it on the eggs so you can eat it together, the tortillas are fresh and home-made tasting, the hash browns and beans were good too.  I read my newspaper and drank my soda while I enjoyed the whole place to myself....oh yeah, I read some Yelp reviews and bookmarked my next stop too, ha ha.</td><td>review</td><td>EP3cGJvYiuOwumerwADplg</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>i213sY5rhkfCO8cD-FPr1A</td><td>2012-07-12</td><td>hre97jjSwon4bn1muHKOJg</td><td>4</td><td>\"Always reliably good.

The sandwich was excellent, served on perfectly crisp, chewy saltimbocca bread. The sausage was flavorful and was complimented by roasted red peppers and onions.

I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!\n\nTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.</td><td>review</td><td>HLbhD2OyiMCUDRR4c1iXaw</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>qjmCVYkwP-HDa35jwYucbQ</td><td>2010-03-28</td><td>2VTwjhOX3UUvgOGbxe4xfA</td><td>4</td><td>I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months.

I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. \n\nVintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...\n\nThe plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.\n\nThe location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n\nThe atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be.

It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.)

Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!\n\nWhen we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.\n\nWhen she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.</td><td>review</td><td>UL9chyH0a4Pj8J_9M6WSpA</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>o5x6DF0KK1OBsiUOx2gavg</td><td>2010-02-04</td><td>IRGqHYbK5AOEv5MNYMz7cQ</td><td>4</td><td>\"This would most certainly be \"\"my\"\" coffee shop if I hadn't already established myself as a regular at another local shop.

The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.

Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  \n\nThat is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.\n\nAs for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). \n\nSo far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.\n\nI did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. \n\nNow for the cliched Yoga Review ending: \n\nNAMASTE!</td><td>review</td><td>mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ</td><td>11</td><td>16</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>8ZwO9VuLDWJOXmtAdc7LXQ</td><td>2010-10-31</td><td>bxPZPvBJp5HwyKVHhcUMLQ</td><td>4</td><td>Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car.

When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.\n\nThe sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :) \n\nWine selection is great and the atmosphere is top notch, but topping it with some of the best servers in town makes this one of my favorites for entertaining. \n\nyou will not be disappointed.</td><td>review</td><td>qT17WVkJi0RvQ4nNPN6NDw</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>9lDZ2d6oRpFsSWwDCCDQOw</td><td>2009-01-31</td><td>WD99RuBcxqvYRCFTf_mT3A</td><td>4</td><td>I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC.

Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation.

I have tried the blueberry muffin-quite yummy as well as the chocolate chip cookies- delicious.  The cafe is attached to The Great Indoors so you can people watch, browse thru design books or take a leisurely stroll through the design center.

They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)\n\nIf you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. \n\nFrom their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30.

Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. \n\nI made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  \n\nMy meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  \n\nOverall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  \n\nJust a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.  \n\nTwo thumbs way down.</td><td>review</td><td>JnRT9i2d71pY8D8ngzCz9Q</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>qRBeZAFiId0ainBtpFSGuQ</td><td>2011-07-24</td><td>NqIsMdYelNlkeK32kJPsCQ</td><td>3</td><td>Returned Sunday afternoon and was  pleasantly suprised.

It was the first chance hubby and I really had a chance to go out to eat without the kids,so we really wanted to make the most of our time.And we wre definetly able to do that here.Refills kept coming even after we had paid the bill.I also loved the live music from the jazz quartet making its way around the room.The only thing thats keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the tables were too close to each other,and it was so loud I could hear the discussion at the table next to me but I had a hard time hearing my huband across the table.I will definetly be going back to Pappadeux over and over again.</td><td>review</td><td>PFaAf7rqKfWXIPiG1qxCiw</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>F-ykHfGY9lWr12OJ_Ofy7A</td><td>2012-03-14</td><td>ty51pvsTv3KxBaeHFWFZrw</td><td>3</td><td>Hit or miss food.

And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.

Yes, it's in the Sheraton, and yes it's near the airport with not much else around, but I have to say- we were both impressed. \n\nWe started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.\n\nIf it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead. Which I suppose is understandable, given that it's inside the Sheraton. The decor was nice though. They should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit.</td><td>review</td><td>4B6aJJTELjivUXrL_LTlqQ</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>nFo_63pTr-4ZhakuaRFOCA</td><td>2012-03-30</td><td>L1ur4N-XFG_kviP0M2_SCA</td><td>5</td><td>I love this restaurant!!

The Kahlua pork at Rumbi is so moist and tender and when its paired with some of their magnificent teriyaki sauce and Rumbi rice (rice cooked with coconut milk and beans), it is out of this world. The Kahlua pork plate at Rumbi has lately been the first meal that comes to mind when I want comfort food. This is a bit of a problem cause that is normally on a work day during lunch and after eating a meal of pork, rice, mac salad, and coleslaw, I am just down right exhausted and in dire need of a nap. \nI used to come here quite frequently but forgot about this place and I am not sure why. Besides the Kahlua pork and Rumbi rice, I can say that their mac salad, sweet potato fries, and their beach burger are really good as well. If you are looking for something different, yet tasty and satisfying, try Rumbi. I think you will enjoy it.</td><td>review</td><td>mlBC3pN9GXlUUfQi1qBBZA</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>35uDzLpJlbSztgkJLtg1kw</td><td>2007-10-14</td><td>jUlDw4GmEsdv8mHqJ3wFfQ</td><td>4</td><td>\"I like coming here when I want to pretend to read and then do some grocery shopping.

A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination.

However, a big plus is that the iced tea is always fresh and all-you-can-drink :-)</td><td>review</td><td>J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>NBwPgX7L2D-EZedgo3A-pw</td><td>2009-08-18</td><td>roMeHsyf55-_O7rpudBbZA</td><td>4</td><td>Gils.. A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. \n\nGils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. \n\nI had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? \n\nThe whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. \n\nThe rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. \n\nThe place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.</td><td>review</td><td>C6IOtaaYdLIT5fWd7ZYIuA</td><td>16</td><td>19</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>VY_tvNUCCXGXQeSvJl757Q</td><td>2012-12-15</td><td>31mOjx2g1F2xAVi20JQP1g</td><td>4</td><td>Good pizza.

The Italia was DELICIOUS and a perfect size! The homemade Minestrone soup was loaded with fresh ingredients and was REALLY fantastic too!\n\nI forgot to try one of their desserts...the last Red Velvet cupcake was ALMOST snatched up by another customer, but the Food Server was so kind to offer to get it to me (maybe I had a look of panic on my face??)...WOW!! This service is rare to find!\n\nThe restrooms are quite amusing! Saw a similar set-up in NYC. Each toilet/water-closet is individual...no stalls. They were VERY CLEAN too (ok, I was seriously apprehensive that it might smell like a men's restroom, since it was all unisex...no worries!!!!)\n\nI can't wait to visit here again...but, after I check out their other place across the street: Joe's Real BBQ.

The olive oil was seasoned perfectly too.  My grandma got the burger and I got the pesto penne primavera.  The pasta came with shrimp, squash, and some other vegetables.  I love pesto, so this hit the spot.  Good serving size, but not too much.  The food tasted fresh.  They make their own pasta, which was delicious.  The burger was huge.  Looked like you get your moneys worth.  The ice tea was even good.  The place was clean and sleek.  They played good music and the service was perfect.  It has been a while since I had such a good overall experience with no complaints.  I will be coming back.

Yum!) to pizza, to ribs.\n\nIt's also a great place to take out-of-state guests who just blew into town from one of those cold climates.

I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.

When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.\n\nComfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.\n\nThey have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not.

The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. \n\nThe service was OK, but not great.

Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.\n\nRumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.</td><td>review</td><td>dYtkphUrU7S2_bjif6k2uA</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ</td><td>2012-12-04</td><td>EI3YXHKCwAIrEj18OVNg-g</td><td>5</td><td>Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing.

The aesthetics of the place were overwhelmingly perfect. I believe the maximum seating capacity of the dining area is 45, yes folks, 45. So the 2 1/2 hour wait was expected, and very VERY worth it. The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated.

I used to love the refrigerator full of beers, the music, and the cool little home, not to mention the biggest thing, the promise of a full bar. Now, everytime I go there it's full of douchebags, they are out of the beer I want, and the music has somehow become sucky. Perhaps the biggest kicker... there is still no full bar! The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality. And I swear if I see one more dude with girls jeans trying to look cool with a bomber of the worst beer imaginable I'm gonna snap.\n\nThanks for ruining what could have been an awesome hang out spot guys.</td><td>review</td><td>JgDkCER12uiv4lbpmkZ9VA</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>hh2lP4_2N-tk_OxmaTf_qA</td><td>2009-09-01</td><td>MFIB6AA1sP7gq49z0Bh29w</td><td>4</td><td>Yes, the view is wonderful. Absolutely. \n\nSadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. \n\nThe decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.\n\nOur party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. \n\nI was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. \n\nThe desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.\n\nThe service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.\n\nValet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike. However, the service did bring me down a bit.</td><td>review</td><td>syF-6VzPdjmCXbTye6N9Eg</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>OFiQ34TNKEE5a00Vd8Kwsg</td><td>2008-11-03</td><td>N9lNmpiOD0bQQTDUvPAMew</td><td>2</td><td>My first visit was roughly two weeks ago when I got a Mediterranean pizza over lunch.

We ordered the Saturday special of Monte Cristo, the potatoes and the biscuits and gravy among other items. The Monte Cristo was perfection and the home made blueberry and strawberry jam was excellent! The potatoes were seasoned to perfection and eggs cooked perfectly.

I've tried the lemon and all the berry flavors, and haven't found anything that wasn't delicious. The prices are reasonable, and you can order sizes from one small scoop to a big box (all unfortunately served in styrofoam).\n\nThere isn't a lot of seating in Angel Sweet, but I've never seen it full.

One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.

Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. \n\nThe rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. \n\nSo then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. \n\nStill, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun.

Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!\n\nI arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.\n\nThe waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.\n\nI ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.\n\nAmbience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  \n\nJasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!\n\nOn completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.\n\nFor the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.</td><td>review</td><td>8qe2c5uRlAkvNFvDriBm1Q</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>8oxnPoOS5wQzhl5LLOm7ow</td><td>2010-07-25</td><td>DCCqJzKnPARsxymujSUkAA</td><td>5</td><td>Awesome country club.

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  \nWhen paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.</td><td>review</td><td>OpUXG69nP4YjlEZDlkdVcQ</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>QIHyWCBG3ftvXbGdHQKdHw</td><td>2012-12-29</td><td>Dv9iSQe9s_kn5uuhy0iM_w</td><td>1</td><td>Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping.

From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\n\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!\n\nSomeday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!</td><td>review</td><td>upssaszVG_egJVRKBU5Dzg</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>ntN85eu27C04nwyPa8IHtw</td><td>2011-01-01</td><td>s2NkuLh0UBmCvHvLwJFBPQ</td><td>4</td><td>I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once!

I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.\n\nThe building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!!

Passed it many times, just didn't catch my eye enough for me to remember it on those nights when I desperately try to think of some new place to try.\n\nI've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.  Ambiance and company made it barely noticeable.   Personally, I don't care as long as I get good service.  We're not family, I don't need an apology or heartfelt goodbye.  The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).  Very cozy place, if you come later or are are willing to wait, you can get a private table in a cave like nook.  The place is not cheap, comparative to other finer dining establishments.

I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.\n\nThere was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner.

I knew it was a school going into the appointment. My issues with the place are as follows:\n1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. \n2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. \n3. The massage was pretty weak. \n4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. \n5. It was difficult to make an appointment here.

Located near Scottsdale Road and Shea, Sandbar has a pretty convenient location and is usually a fun spot to go out dancing and drinking.  The DJ is either hit or miss; sometimes he plays awesome music and everyone's on the dance floor and other times the dance floor is completely empty because the music ain't so great. \nI've always wondered if anyone has become so intoxicated while at Sandbar that they have fallen into the little pond outside. Unfortunately, I have never seen this happen.\nBut I have woken up in the morning with a Sandbar server schedule in my pocket with no recollection as to why.\nMy friend was dancing so crazy one night on one of the platforms, that when she jumped off, she sprained her ankle. \nSee? Sandbar's a really good time.\nOh and if you get hungry, there's a little hot dog cart out front, so you can eat a wiener, drink and be merry.</td><td>review</td><td>0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>yb17xHvhDJthJGS10uhFeQ</td><td>2010-09-16</td><td>kfJC_crlXCUQ-UgXNR04Ew</td><td>4</td><td>\"My name is Amy and I'm a comedian.

What a hike.  Coming from Colorado, though, the relative comparison makes it just a 3.  \n\nFirstly, it's definitely treacherous.  When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). \n\nIt was a fun jaunt.  The view was worth it - not entirely picturesque as far as nature goes, but it was nice view of the city and surrounding area.  If you go, just be wary of the sun/heat, and know that you'll be clambering over and around boulders and such.

When we sat down there was a birthday card signed by the employees of the restaurant -- a very nice touch.  For appetizers, we had oysters and the (best) crab cakes (anywhere).  Steaks and seafood as our main courses paired well with the red cabernet wine.  Overall, just incredible.  Completely up to par with Eddie V's standards -- comparing to Houston and Austin.  My mom forgot her sweater at the booth and a hostess ran out to give it to her.  We also got a follow-up phone call the next day asking how everything went.

This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. \n\nI had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.\n\nMy girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. \n\nI would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok.

While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. \n\nI am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. \n\nBreakfast: \n\nBreakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. \n\nLunch:\n\nLunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.</td><td>review</td><td>4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>8cL7aJVKTYmLguzXEAS3Lw</td><td>2011-09-09</td><td>-GIRAMumwpwkJ790HOd9KQ</td><td>5</td><td>\"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.

Pat down some chicken-turkey (no taste difference as far as I can tell) with the wax paper.  Load up with mostly veggies (more green than red or white), add some wheat noodles to fill the bowl to the brim.  Follow with the sweet and sour mix but add some extra vinegar and orange sauce.  Add some pineapple and all set to have it grilled.  Fill a small bowl with peanuts and another small bowl with pineapple.  Fill the large red plastic drinking vessel with ice and low cal lemonade.  Then chow down...\n\nMy formula has more or less stayed the same since being introduced to YC's by Mike T and/or Erik T.  Both took different approaches and none tasted like the other despite selecting choices from the same line.  Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark.</td><td>review</td><td>J72XoQspNBmPsX2iKl2YvA</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Y_TtMiH_nx33FH4C48XhsA</td><td>2011-04-16</td><td>gwGGLhbcx27rzz3D9jVudA</td><td>5</td><td>Called these guys when an evap cooler water pressure line at my office burst.

If your in the area Chili's or Connolys is much better choice in my oppinion.</td><td>review</td><td>-US_SpFlEAsu3ZRWY8Bsvw</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>bc-lE-wGVAsUrX-kJhtY-Q</td><td>2008-04-01</td><td>Tx0t7Jr6K7UicgbWympFsA</td><td>2</td><td>This place was so bad on so many levels I'm not even sure where to begin. Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?\n\nSo I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. \n\nOver all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.</td><td>review</td><td>lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>soiGohHtWOltGeomkSxzEw</td><td>2012-03-29</td><td>zMuTMydgOXEXA7ycogchyA</td><td>1</td><td>\"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.

No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. \n\nThe fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? \n\nThe process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with.

However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat\n\nTako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily\n\nThe ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.

The full portions will fill an average 200lb guy, so it's nice that smaller folk like myself have the option of getting the small (or \"\"senior) portion! </td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>Save room for their personal-sized pies...you won't regret it!\"</td><td>review</td><td>x5ve4LVa-iIfZ65Qe9Pqvg</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>null</td></tr><tr><td>C6gkuLYG_NOobXxaXwUUpA</td><td>2007-03-08</td><td>WowIQci4KEfcKZEeAdydmA</td><td>1</td><td>this another place that i would give no stars to if possible. \nit's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.\n\ni went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.\n\nafter seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.\n\nseriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?</td><td>review</td><td>7GC9fVWKa4a1ZmBGLH6Uww</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Xq9tkiHhyN_aBFswFeGLvA</td><td>2011-03-21</td><td>cVDmpkto6Fs-LwCkxKPx3g</td><td>2</td><td>I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.\n\nFirst off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.\n\nLets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.\n\nNext the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.\n\nDrinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   \n\nNow the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.\nNo value\n\nFood:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.\nMy mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.\n\nDessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.\n\nValue:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!</td><td>review</td><td>zNR8Q6Fw9UvlVSgxwEy-3Q</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>B6sT5YGBYB9KfhkiZtzQ4A</td><td>2013-01-02</td><td>IdFTGG7jVjN-NAJc09hKYg</td><td>4</td><td>We have tried every Chinese delivery in Chander over the past few years and have found them all to be barely edible...and we aren't picky eaters.

It makes you feel like you're eating healthy (Note - doesn't really encourage healthy eating, more just a healthy attitude.  Keeps the brownies, chocolate pudding, pizza and mayo based salads in large supply) And then finally - Coupons.  They have coupons ALL the time.

If you're paying w/ debit card, they will ask you if you want to include a tip.  That threw me.

The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.\n\nI recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.

If you're from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since you'll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars.\n\nI went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that I've gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need.\n\nThe rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.\n\nThe pool area is where it's at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on.</td><td>review</td><td>0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Gq092IH6eZqhAXwtXcwc6A</td><td>2012-12-02</td><td>OXFYCSpUaaNJWoW1zk0wYw</td><td>4</td><td>Great brewery and open atmosphere!

It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.</td><td>review</td><td>Hb49IsEZltm85wLz3uMrmw</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>XTIIAZspxssIF7WenlXmrA</td><td>2011-09-11</td><td>OG6fluz_DxfnMYcfnmmqrA</td><td>3</td><td>\"Spa whore, I am!

It compares particularly favorably with the doudy, sour old St. Francis in San Francisco, a venue I hope we never book again.\n\nThe standout quality of this place is the hustle and quality of the service.  Our opening night reception included an array of food service stations with different themes, including a noodle bar that was particuarly well done.  The food was all delicious but what really distinguished this event was the personable, attentive, extra-mile oriented staff.  They were reading the nametags of our 200 guests and calling people by name whenever possible and chatting us up in line to make sure we were all happy.\n\nThe event coordinators were all over the venue throughout the ensuing two days.  Where at the St. Francis we struggled with temperature and electrical problems and grumpy, uncooperative, disinterested staff, here at the Fairmont, the very few glitches drew aggressive responses by people who cared about our event.</td><td>review</td><td>r5uiIxwJ-I-oHBkNY2Ha3Q</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>SGwnJIFKGQcYzE2c3ebs8A</td><td>2012-01-13</td><td>IXh7sAr5xSqiuf1xhCPmWQ</td><td>5</td><td>Nooooooooo!

There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.\n\nEven though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.</td><td>review</td><td>MrQCy8eJD1x51U87J5C6ZQ</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>k8Y7aXXA8BFcn5CillHFYw</td><td>2010-06-16</td><td>raaH2O1gL1H712CjHv_lwQ</td><td>3</td><td>Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines.

Good house wine by the carafe, we had the French Merlot.  Very inconsistent food quality.  I had the spinach and frisee salad.  The poached egg was overcooked, so no yolk to add the a very dry salad.  No enough bacon fat to wilt the salad properly.  An average quality lamb shank without any evidence of the olives and other seasonings promised.  My friends filet of beef was ordered medium rare and served med. well.  Rather dry.  They refused to subsitute for the brussels sprouts, then the waiter came back and said they could do it after all.  Desert souflles were ordered by two diners, both were dry and flavorless.  They need to pay more attention in the kitchen.  Overall, a very average experience at above average pricing.</td><td>review</td><td>4QORbyhfN01oKR_GgBstfQ</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-4A5xmN21zi_TXnUESauUQ</td><td>2012-07-09</td><td>0bQUqKGw0uGobtP7S-EkAw</td><td>4</td><td>\"Came here and did drive-though to pick up a turkey sandwich and the \"\"man\"\" salad.

So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.\n\nBut in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. \n\nIt has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. \n\nYou are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. \n\nThis is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.</td><td>review</td><td>2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>k8JnZBspVOI8kLcQek-Chw</td><td>2012-01-09</td><td>dGzFMtE5JQ3YkUHS6UU0uA</td><td>5</td><td>\"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a \"\"GOOD\"\" Pizza.

I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.

Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  \n\nDottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  \n\nI've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.\n\nBecause it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).\n\nThe two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.\n\nI don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner.</td><td>review</td><td>0lxf4v5NuJ1U6Bk7SGAJ5w</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg</td><td>2012-09-24</td><td>1n6AhAJ6n92x_vesTaWZyA</td><td>4</td><td>Now THIS is ramen!

Great food! Great service! Still, this place isn't perfect....\n\nBE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so.\n\nService: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!\n\nThe pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best we've ever had. ...I just don't know if I'll hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.</td><td>review</td><td>UuwjD6MZf6Z6QlNphiXRjA</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>BINYfrtGp3A4w0d5E7kbYw</td><td>2012-04-22</td><td>oIPCrYI-fRmOFaDcJGMoLg</td><td>5</td><td>Very delicious and friendly!

I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and the crispy tortillas were a nice texture contrast to the rest of the dish.\n\nWill definitely be back, and would definitely recommend that people check this place out for brunch... just don't take my table.</td><td>review</td><td>KzFTp00JdzuggUHaRn_uzQ</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>V6BYjHM9SnXscfkln3hCdA</td><td>2012-06-27</td><td>h3vM0J9MuqpLscQAPp5hfQ</td><td>1</td><td>\"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.

This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.\n\nOur waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. \n\nLooking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting.

This weekend is a big sale.  I ran in earlier to return something and walked out with a new pair of shoes.  Oops.  Take that as a warning, Nordstrom can be dangerous for shop-a-holics.\n\nThe only times I have not gotten lucky at Nordstrom are when I've been on a mission for something specific - such as Converse Sneakers in Jared's size 7 or a certain shirt or bathing suit in my size.

The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.\n\nThen, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.</td><td>review</td><td>sA0sK9l9VxsynxvrOgmBXQ</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q</td><td>2012-05-21</td><td>Om_B3VbViUp9hzk42Xn20Q</td><td>5</td><td>\"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!!

The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. \n\nExperiences with the order could be as follows: \nGobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. \nLamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. \nChicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. \nDisheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. \n\nFinally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.</td><td>review</td><td>LMlBCXFVAHdPnSA94jc6PQ</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>gXkv89nyNlFyrEdblB3MKw</td><td>2011-07-11</td><td>_vzqn2kve9Mp05Vsm_c7ow</td><td>5</td><td>great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular</td><td>review</td><td>nM3vfxr6fcnN_nXdzwbVCw</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>nfyqtEoufkhjv97IueK7Ow</td><td>2011-03-04</td><td>6-Bd6EH7f4iOClnPi3R5pg</td><td>1</td><td>Here's the 1. 2. 3...\n\n1.

GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)\n\nHow do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.\n\nI recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!\n\nAdvice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.\n\nAsk the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!</td><td>review</td><td>Vyl9tU5OeDcZND37iObmOw</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Agz-gMJfjCsK5tdKC6FBYQ</td><td>2011-05-04</td><td>JpmTOGXZYOwEY3tV7x2OoA</td><td>3</td><td>Not bad.

It was standard Sonoran.\n\nWith that said, the meal was quite enjoyable. The enchilada sauce had a nice flavor. The dulce de leche was fantastic. The service was very good. The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.  We would probably come back.\n\nI had to give it 3-stars because of what it is not. If you are looking for Spanish food - there is none here.

The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.\n\nThe second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.\n\np.s.

I would only complain that their water glasses are far too small, especially for some of their spicier dishes.  I think the expectation is that you have cocktail to help you wash away some of the heat.  Speaking of their cocktails, the martinis, which I have had on a different occasion, are quite good.

The Menu is limited but whatever you order you will not be disappointed.</td><td>review</td><td>pcYFt1EjfOizhvRJDiz3AA</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>luCSjoNQ9q_0QIjKKOy2pQ</td><td>2010-08-07</td><td>RfpcyW2C579dHixRbwa9XA</td><td>4</td><td>If you like beer, you'll love Papago.

I used to work by there and the curbside pick-up is fantastic. Other than that? I find myself hesitating to go there now because of the atrocious parking situation. This place is an absolute zoo on the weekends and when I can't find a parking spot by the restaurant, I find myself parking in the surrounding neighborhood worrying that my car may be towed when I come out! \n\nNeedless to say, their homemade English Muffins are amazing. I really could just survive on those happily for the rest of my life. The grape preserves on the side are fantastic as well...and I don't even like grape preserves! That, paired with their coffee, makes for one of the best breakfasts in the Valley. And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)\n\nThis place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off. \n\nIf you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up. That way, you can enjoy LGO without the frustration of finding the mythical parking spot, standing in a long line (albeit trendy) and searching for a table with everybody else so you don't have to eat the wonderfulness standing up.</td><td>review</td><td>wB7YiVcqEWyL7arlVLsa-g</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Qr232ykh-d73aAKQqfdu8Q</td><td>2010-12-28</td><td>hAWU7LKCKdeM0lYyYfY3fQ</td><td>5</td><td>Can't go wrong with an iced gingerbread latte, hot waffle with Nutella spread and free wi-fi - especially shared with my beautiful wife. :)</td><td>review</td><td>ehCtzkedHa4Oq5c0IJ9X8A</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>NAkRjPhS4yCD5trp0dY-bQ</td><td>2012-07-01</td><td>5luYHSisIHcx7YtZohJPaQ</td><td>1</td><td>Refused to call me a cab because I had a phone.</td><td>review</td><td>4OFp34tCTh9Pps5nsjt_lw</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>MHy50GRrcXxMORpF_-kNCA</td><td>2008-01-24</td><td>INhnWFbTOFOil3Q_Is0RGw</td><td>5</td><td>Yup, I'm reviewing a gas station. I like the Quiktrip chain in general and this station in particular.\n\nI find Quiktrips to generally be the cheapest gas in town. Sure, the Arco sign down the street might say it's 2 cents/gallon cheaper, but then you get whacked with the ATM surcharge, not to mention there's all those bums loitering in the adjacent bus stop.\n\nWith Quiktrip, the place is well lit, there's always a trash can and window squeegee at every pump, the convenience store is better than most, and unlike most other gas stations, they don't charge you for the air compressor. Oh, and the person at the register will actually greet you when you step inside the door, while managing to sound sincere about it. Is that the coolest thing for a convenience store or what? \n\nBonus: for those of you who enjoy shopping at the Hot Chick Safeway down the street, this is the Hot Chick Gas Station.</td><td>review</td><td>BX9K5JMU-NnjxJaNKxImpQ</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>0COaKgRuDzBisc2AxcLzMA</td><td>2010-11-28</td><td>Q79BryA9gKNujzm39jpDKQ</td><td>2</td><td>As a pretty devoted Fry's shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations.

I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! \n\nThe chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. \n\nWe just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.</td><td>review</td><td>thdVzCfKx-DV0zYWqId3pw</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>UUssRgBCO_riWg3chbv9Zg</td><td>2011-12-27</td><td>gNepvdQlS4feEB92g33qVw</td><td>2</td><td>Not impressed.

We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF. \n\nI can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasn't gelling for me this night I suppose. \n\nWe ordered the deep Fried green chili's and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chili's just to get a small bite. icky. \n\nI would give this another chance just because I hate writing a bad review. So, after the holidays, may check it out on a Friday night and see where it stands then, Also, I will hope that when I arrive next time, the smoker out back is kicking and there is some REAL BBQ to be had.</td><td>review</td><td>VaLglvhXegtW1OMF6_Xfag</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>byhwHi0lhYdyY5kSpuqoaQ</td><td>2012-05-26</td><td>PgSPQE9n-c3FqUhmSoJHAw</td><td>4</td><td>Here last night with friends.

We were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal, and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night.

They're real, and they're spectacular. \n\nOf course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. \n\nAlthough Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.\n\nSpeaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was \"\"Squaw\"\" Peak.

And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.  \n\nMy only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow.
